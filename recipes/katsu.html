    <h3>Description</h3>
<p>Beef katsu is a Japanese dish featuring a juicy beef cutlet coated in crispy panko breadcrumbs, fried to golden perfection. Served with a tangy tonkatsu sauce and a side of shredded cabbage, it’s a satisfying meal that’s both crunchy and tender.</p>
<p>This recipe is a twist on the classic katsu, using beef instead of pork, offering a rich flavor that pairs beautifully with steamed rice or miso soup.</p>

<li>2 cups shredded cabbage</li>
<li>Lemon wedges for serving</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
